	"content": "Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) Topic and Email Subscription Overview Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SNS allows you to create \u0026ldquo;topics\u0026rdquo; which are communication channels to send messages or notifications to a large number of subscribers.\nKey Steps to Create an SNS Topic and Subscribe an Email 1. Create an SNS Topic: An SNS topic is a logical access point that acts as a communication channel. You can create a topic using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs. When creating a topic, specify a name and configure settings such as access policies, delivery retry policies, and more. 2. Subscribe an Email Address to the Topic: Once the topic is created, you can add subscriptions to it. In this case, the subscription type is \u0026ldquo;email.\u0026rdquo; The specified email address will receive a confirmation request. The subscription is only active after the recipient confirms it by clicking on the link in the email.
